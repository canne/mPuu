By browsing the site makijarvi.fi you would understand what
this family tree extension package for Mediawi is doing:
- it parses application specific MediaWiki templates ...
- ... top create XML files in local file system DB
- it renders different class views out of these XML files:
- * family tree (father but also mother line),
- * location (town/street/house) data and relationships
- allows running big family tree PDF-file from the "database"

XML, Python (very old, 2 something) and PHP (7).

There is no ASCII-format installation instructions within the distribution,
sorry about that. You would need to take a look at

http://www.makijarvi.fi/wiki/index.php/mPuu:User%27s_Guide

which might be written with a strange language called Finnish, and
I have some doubts that by switching to English the page would exist...
