mPuu note:

- all the files in this dicectory (not the directory itself) are physically
  located in this directory.
- they are _hard_ linked to with a corresponding file name from directory
  $HOME/mPuu/scgi-bin
- the development work and CVS management of these files takes place
  in the $HOME/mPuu/scgi-bin directory
- the files need to import Python library files from ../../mPuu/lib,
  therefore relocation of this directory or the mPuu directory requires
  that the Python search path is modified in each file.
- Note that the _editing_ and all other work with the README and *.py files
  should be done in the actual location of scgi-bin directory
- CVS is used just to keep the version history
- When the local work is done, the *.py file permissions in the scgi-bin
  must be set to "chmod 555 *.py". This cannot be done with cvs unedit
  command.
